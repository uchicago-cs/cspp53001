<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
Your programming project for CSPP 53001 will be to build a substantial
database application that provides the basic functionality of Twitter
and adds or changes some of the features (hence the "Plus"). You
should certainly preserve the basic concepts of tweeting and following
but you are free to add or omit any other aspects such as HashTags,
Favorites, Lists, etc.
</p>
<p>
First, you will design the E/R diagram for your TBP, then you will
transform the E/R diagram to a relational schema for the database, and
you will create an actual database using MySQL. You will populate the
database with lots of data, write interactive queries and
modifications on the database. Finally, you will develop an online
interface to your TBP.
</p>
<p>
Your first step is to identify the features of your TBP that you would
like to manage with your database, and to construct an
entity-relationship diagram for the data. Try to pick an app that is
relatively substantial, but not too enormous. For example, when
expressed in the entity-relationship model, you might want your design
to have five to ten entity sets, and a similar number of
relationships.  The total number of entity sets plus relationships for
most reasonable designs should be between 10 and 20. If you feel that
your app is too complex or too simple, please, discuss it with the TAs
or the instructor.
</p>
<p>
You should certainly include different kinds of relationships (e.g.,
many-to-one, many-to-many) and different kinds of data (strings,
integers, etc.), but your app is not required to use advanced
features, such as subclassing, multiway relationships, or weak entity
sets, if they are not appropriate for your scenario.
</p>
<p>
Here are a few hints on getting started with your E/R diagram. You can
start with the Users (or perhaps Twitterers?) and Tweets entity sets.
Then you can create two relationship Following and Sends. Following
will be a many-to-many relationship between Users and Users while
Sends will be a one-to-many relationship between Users and
Tweets. Next, you can consider how to add the concept of Re-tweeting
to your E/R diagram.
</p>
<p>
<b>So, here is what you need to do for step 1 of your TBP:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe the TBP that you propose in a few paragraphs in a text
</li>
</ol>

<p>file called <code>TBP_description.txt</code> Your description should be brief and
relatively informal. Your description will be graded only on
suitability and conciseness.
</p><ol>
<li>Specify an entity-relationship diagram for your proposed
</li>
</ol>

<p>database. As always, don't forget to underline key attributes and
include arrowheads and rounded arrows indicating the multiplicity of
relationships. If there are weak entity sets, indicate them by double
lines, as described in class.
</p>
<p>
   The recommended tool for creating your E/R diagram is <a href="http://erdplus.com/">ERDplus</a>. Of
   course, you can draw the diagram using any software you like. You
   can also draw the diagram by hand and then scan it. Store your ER
   diagram in a file called <code>TBP_ERD.???</code>. Note that the file should
   be in some readable format such as pdf, bmp or png.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Transform the E/R diagram you created to a relational schema as
</li>
</ol>

<p>follows:
</p><ul>
<li>Using the method for translating an E/R diagram to relations,
</li>
</ul>

<p>produce a set of relations for your database design, underlining key
attributes in your relations.
</p><ul>
<li>For each relation in your schema, specify a set of nontrivial
</li>
</ul>

<p>functional dependencies that hold based on your particular app. <i>Some of your relations may have no nontrivial functional dependencies.</i>
Show the relational schema and the functional dependencies in a text
file called <code>TBP_schema.txt</code>
</p>
<p>
You will submit your homework using the <code>hwsubmit</code> command. Please,
create a new directory called hw1_&lt;your_username&gt;,
e.g. hw1_evtimov, and move all of the relevant files there:
<code>TBP_description.txt, TBP_ERD.???, TBP_schema.txt</code>. Then, you can
submit your work by typing (&lt;path_to&gt; is the directory path to your
hw1 directory):
</p>
<p>
<code>hwsubmit cspp53001 &lt;path_to&gt;/hw1_&lt;your_username&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
<b>Please make sure that all of the relevant files and no others are in that directory.</b>
</p>
<p>
If you are having trouble thinking of any additional features for your
Twitter Basic Plus, or if you are unsure whether your proposed
features are appropriate, please feel free to consult with the TA or
the instructor.

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Gradiance Problem Set 2</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
You will complete the problem set using <a href="http://www.newgradiance.com/">Gradiance</a>.
</p>
<p>
The name of the homework is CSPPDB-Spr13 HW2. There are 11 questions in
this homework - 10 regular questions and one extra credit one (about
seven subsets). All questions in this problem set are multiple choice.
However, to answer them correctly you will need to work out their long
(general) answers. A correct answer is worth 3 points. You lose a point
for each incorrect answer. You can attempt the problem set as many times
as you like; only your highest score will count. Note that you will
probably get slightly different questions each time you take it.
