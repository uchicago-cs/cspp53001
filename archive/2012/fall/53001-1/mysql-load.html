<p><A NAME="overview"></A><b>Overview</b>
<p>
To load data in MySQL, you need to create a <I>data file</I>,
which specifies <I>what</I> data should be loaded and then run a command that specifies <i>how</i> data should be loaded.

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<p><A NAME="creating the data file"></A><b>Creating the Data File</b>
<p>Each line in the data file specifies one tuple to be loaded into <TT>&lt;tableName></TT>.
It lists, in order, values for the attributes in the list specified in
the <tt>LOAD</tt> command (described below), separated by <TT>&lt;separator></TT>. As a concrete example, consider relation <i>Likes(drinker, beer)</i> and a data file 
<TT>likes.dat</TT> that might look like:
<PRE>zarko|Guinness
karin|Bud
karin| BudLite</PRE>
As a result of loading <TT>likes.dat</TT>, the following tuples are inserted into <TT>Likes</TT>:
<PRE>('zarko', 'Guinness')
('karin', 'Bud')
('karin', ' BudLite')</PRE>
<B>Warning:</B> Note that the third line of <TT>likes.dat</TT> has a blank
after "<TT>|</TT>". This blank is <I>not</I> ignored by the loader. The
value to be loaded for attribute <TT>beer</TT> is <TT>' Bud'</TT>, a four-character
string with a leading blank. It is a common mistake to assume that <TT>'Bud'</TT>,
a three-character string with no leading blank, will be loaded instead.
This can lead to some very frustrating problems that you will not notice
until you try to query your loaded data, because <TT>' Bud'</TT> and <TT>'Bud'</TT>
are different strings.

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<p><A NAME="loading your data"></A><b>Loading Your Data</b>
<p>
A simple load command has the following form:
<PRE>LOAD DATA
LOCAL INFILE "&lt;dataFile&gt;"
REPLACE INTO TABLE &lt;tableName&gt;
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '&lt;separator&gt;'
(&lt;list of all attribute names to load&gt;)</PRE>

<UL>
<LI>
<TT>&lt;dataFile></TT> is the name of the data file.  The optional keyword <tt>LOCAL</tt> means that the filename is interpreted with respect to the client end of the connection, i.e. your home directory rather than the mysql server (<tt>interlibrary.cs.uchicago.edu</tt>)</LI>

<LI>
<TT>&lt;tableName></TT> is the name of the table to which data will be
loaded. Of course, it should have been created already before the bulk
load operation.</LI>

<LI>
The optional keyword <TT>REPLACE</TT> controls handling of input records that duplicate existing records on unique key values.  <tt>REPLACE</tt> means that when there are duplicates the new tuples are used and the old ones are deleted. <tt>IGNORE</tt> means that the new tuples are ignored and the old ones kept.  

<LI>
<TT>&lt;separator></TT> specifies the field separator for your data file.
This can be any single character. It is a good idea to use a character
that you know will never appear in the data, so the separator will not
be confused with data fields.</LI>

<LI>
Finally, list the names of attributes of <TT>&lt;tableName></TT> that are
set by your data file, separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.
This list need not be the complete list of attributes in the actual schema
of the table, nor must it be arranged in the same order as the attributes
when the table was created.  Any attributes unspecified in the list
of attributes will be set to their default values, if declared, and <TT>NULL</TT> otherwise.
</LI>
</UL>
As a concrete example, here is a <TT>LOAD</TT> command for loading <tt>likes.dat</tt> into <tt>Likes</tt>:
<PRE>LOAD DATA
LOCAL INFILE "likes.dat"
REPLACE INTO TABLE Likes
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|'
(drinker, beer)</PRE>

<p> For more information on the <tt>LOAD</tt> command consult the online MySQL <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/load-data.html">documentation</a>. 


<HR WIDTH="100%">
<p><A NAME="entering nulls"></A><b>Entering NULL Values</b>
<P>
You may specify <TT>NULL</TT> values simply by entering \N.  For example, if we were entering integer 
values into a table with schema <TT>(a, b, c)</TT> specified in the 
<TT>LOAD</TT> command, the following lines in the data file:
<PRE>3|\N|5
\N|2|4
1|\N|6
\N|\N|7</PRE>
<P>would result in inserting the following tuples in the relation:
<PRE>(3, NULL, 5)
(NULL, 2, 4)
(1, NULL, 6)
(NULL, NULL, 7)</PRE>
<P>Keep in mind that any primary keys or other constraints requiring that 
values be non-<TT>NULL</TT> will reject tuples for which those
attributes are unspecified.  

<P>
If you do not wish to enter values for any row of a given column, you can,
as mentioned above, leave that column out of the attribute list
altogether.
