<h3>Final Step of Your TBP App</h3> 

The final part of your TBP App project is to create a basic web site powered by your
database using the php programming language and a web server.  
<p>

<p> First, you will add data entry functionality to the web interface
created in part 7. Then, you will create individual pages corresponding to
different aspects of your application.
<p>

<p> You will create several new web pages that will comprise the data
entry interface to your TBP App.  Each web page should contain at least
one form that implements some data entry functionality needed by your
TBP.  For example, you can have a registration page for new users,
followed by a menu page that directs users to choose other users to
follow and write tweets.  Your functions and their parameters will depend
on your schema and application scenario.

<p> You can also incorporate the functions you wrote for part 7 by
adding them to the appropriate pages of your site.  For example, you
can add any search functions to the home page for each user (the page
that appears after a user logs in).

<p>The point of entry to your web site should be named
<tt>final.html</tt> and should be placed in your <tt>/stage/cgi-cspp/&lt;your_username&gt;/public_html/cs53001/</tt>
directory.  Make sure that this page is viewable by a browser.  The url is:
<tt>http://cgi-cspp.cs.uchicago.edu/~&lt;your_username&gt;/cs53001/final.html</tt>.

<p>
You will submit your homework by emailing <i>csppdb at cs.uchicago.edu</i> the link
to your TBP App.
