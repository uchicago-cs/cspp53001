The name of the homework is CSPPDB-Aut12 HW1.  All questions in this
problem set are multiple choice.  However, to answer them correctly
you will need to work out their long (general) answers.  A correct
answer is worth 3 points.  You lose a point for each incorrect
answer. You can attempt the problem set as many times as you like; only
your highest score will count.  Note that you will probably get slightly
different questions each time you take it.
<p>
<b>The due date for the Gradiance part of the homework is 11:59pm on Wednesday, October 10, 2012.</b>
