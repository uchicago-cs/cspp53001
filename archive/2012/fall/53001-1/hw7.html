<h3>Step 7 of Your TBP App</h3> 

The seventh part of your TBP project is to create a web interface to
your database using the php programming language and a web server.
<p>

First, you will need to request an <a
href="https://tools.cs.uchicago.edu/activate_cgi_service">account</a>
on the CS CGI server.  Then you should create a directory named
<tt>cs53001</tt> in your
<tt>/stage/cgi-cspp/&lt;your_username&gt;/public_html</tt> directory.

<p> Next, you will create a web page that will be the (temporary)
interface to your TBP.  This web page should consist of links and
forms and short explanations for any complex functions that implement
the functionality needed by your TBP app.  The functions and their
parameters will depend on your schema and application scenario but you
should certainly include functions that display users and tweets based
on some conditions.

<p>Every link and form on this web page should correspond to (and
implement) a particular functionality of your TBP app.  For this
assignment, you will only need to implement 8-10 functions.  You don't
have to implement any functions that modify your database such as
registering a new user or sending a tweet - you will get to do that in
the last part of your TBP app.


<p>Here is an example of a web page, <a
href="tbp.html.txt"><tt>tbp.html</tt></a>, that has a link
to a php script <a
href="list_tables.php.txt"><tt>list_tables.php</tt></a> and a form
that runs <a href="list_attrs.php.txt"><tt>list_attrs.php</tt></a>.
Note that the names of the files have an extra <tt>.txt</tt> extension
so the source code can be viewed in your browser.  The second php file
assumes that you have a table Users with several attributes.

<p>For a quick primer on HTML forms you can go to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp</a>.

<p>
For more information on how to handle form variables passed to php refer to this section of the php manual <a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.external.php">http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.external.php</a>.

<p>
For more information on accessing MySQL from php read <a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.mysql.php">http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.mysql.php</a>.

<p>
Your web page that contains all links and forms should be named`
<tt>tbp.html</tt> and should be placed in your <tt>/stage/cgi-cspp/&lt;your_username&gt;/public_html/cs53001/</tt>
directory.  Make sure that this page is viewable by a browser.  The url is:
<tt>http://cgi-cspp.cs.uchicago.edu/~&lt;your_username&gt;/cs53001/tbp.html</tt>.

<p>
You will submit your homework by emailing the TAs and instructor a link to your TBP web page.


<h3>Problem Set</h3> 

You will complete two SQL labs using <a
href="http://www.newgradiance.com/">Gradiance</a> (http://www.newgradiance.com/).
The names of the SQL Labs are CSPPDB-Aut12 HW7a and CSPPDB-Aut12 HW7b

<p><b>The due date for the SQL labs is midnight on Tuesday, December 4, 2012.</b>
