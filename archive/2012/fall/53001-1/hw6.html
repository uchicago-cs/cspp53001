<h3>Step 6 of Your TBP App</h3> 

The sixth part of your TBP project is to create several triggers and stored routines.  

<p>Create at least three triggers and show that they work. One of
your triggers should enforce an attribute constraint.  You should also
have a trigger that keeps track of some quantity such as the number of
tuples in a relation, or an aggregate function of some attribute.
Please, create a script <tt>triggers.sql</tt> that includes all of
your trigger definitions.  To show that your triggers work create a
script <tt>scenario1.sql</tt> that shows, for each trigger, the effect
of two database modifications. One modification should activate the
trigger while the other should not. In the script, show queries that
demonstrate that the trigger has an effect in the first case and not
in the second one.

<p> Create at least three stored routines, with at least one including a
database modification, and show that they work. Please, create, a
script <tt>routines.sql</tt> that includes all of your stored routine
definitions.  To show that your routines work create a script
<tt>scenario2.sql</tt> that shows the effect of each routine.  For
routines including database modifications show the instance of an
affected relation before and after the routine is called.

<p> In addition to the four new scripts, please, also
submit <tt>create_db_large.sql</tt> and <tt>populate_db_large.sql</tt>
scripts along with <b>all data files</b> referenced in your
<tt>populate_db_large.sql</tt> script from hw5.  You can modify these
scripts in order to ensure that your triggers and routines work as
expected.


<p> You will submit your homework using the <tt>hwsubmit</tt> command.
Please, create a new directory called hw6_&lt;your_username&gt;,
e.g. hw6_evtimov, and move there all of the relevant scripts <b>and
all data files</b>.  For this assignment, there should be the four new
scripts: <tt>triggers.sql, scenario1.sql, routines.sql,
scenario2.sql</tt>, the scripts from
hw5: <tt>create_db_large.sql</tt>, <tt>populate_db_large.sql</tt>, 
and all the large data files, Then, you can
submit your work by typing (&lt;path_to&gt; is the directory path to
your hw6 directory):

<p> 

<tt>hwsubmit cspp53001 &lt;path_to&gt;/hw6_&lt;your_username&gt;</tt>

<p>

<b>Please make sure that all of the relevant files and no others are in that directory.</b>



<hr> <h3>Problem Set</h3> You will
complete the problem set using <a
href="http://www.newgradiance.com/">Gradiance</a> (http://www.newgradiance.com/).

<p>
The name of the homework is CSPPDB-Aut12 HW6.  There are 10 questions
in this homework.
All questions in this problem set are multiple
choice.  However, to answer them correctly you will need to work out
their long (general) answers.  A correct answer is worth 3 points.
You lose a point for each incorrect answer. You can attempt the
problem set as many times as you like; only your highest score will
count.  
Note that
you will probably get slightly different questions each time you
attempt the problem set.
<p>
<b>The due date for the Gradiance part of the homework is 11:59pm on Monday, November 26, 2012.</b>
