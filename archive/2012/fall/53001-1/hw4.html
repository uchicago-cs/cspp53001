<h3>Step 3 of Your TBP</h3> 

The third part of the TBP project is to design and run some interesting queries
involving joins and aggregation.  Please, choose your queries
carefully and add comments that describe the purpose of each query.
Your queries should correspond to actions or functionality that your
TBP app may implement.  For example, you may want to find all users
that follow at least one twitterer that you follow.

<ol>
<li>Develop and test at least eight SQL queries involving joins.
Please, generate a script file called <tt>joins3.sql</tt> with all of
your queries.

<li>Develop and test at least eight SQL queries involving aggregation. 
Please, generate a script file called <tt>aggrs3.sql</tt> with all of your queries.

<p> When you write the join and aggregation queries, consider the
functionality of your TBP app.  Try to write queries that will be useful
in implementing some features of your TBP app.  For example, displaying
the tweets of all of the users someone follows will involve a join
while listing the number of followers for any user will be an
aggregation query.

<li>Develop and test at least two each of the four types of SQL data
modification commands: <tt>insert</tt> a single tuple, <tt>insert</tt>
a subquery,
<tt>delete</tt>, <tt>update</tt>.  Please, generate a script file
called <tt>mods3.sql</tt> with all of your modifications.

</ol>


<p> You will submit your homework using the <tt>hwsubmit</tt> command.
Please, create a new directory called hw3_&lt;your_username&gt;,
e.g. hw3_evtimov, and move all of the relevant scripts and data files
there.  Then, you can submit your work by typing (&lt;path_to&gt; is the directory path to your hw3 directory).

<p> 

<tt>hwsubmit cspp53001 &lt;path_to&gt;/hw3_&lt;your_username&gt;</tt>

<p>

<b>Please make sure that all of the relevant files and no others are in that directory.</b>

<hr> <h3>Problem Set</h3> You will
complete the problem set using <a
href="http://www.newgradiance.com/">Gradiance</a> (http://www.newgradiance.com/).

<p>
The name of the homework is CSPPDB-Aut12 HW4.  There are 11 questions
in this homework - 10 regular questions and one extra credit one
(about outer joins).  All questions in this problem set are multiple
choice.  However, to answer them correctly you will need to work out
their long (general) answers.  A correct answer is worth 3 points.
You lose a point for each incorrect answer. You can attempt the
problem set as many times as you like; only your highest score will
count.  You do not have to solve the challenge question to receive
full credit but if you get it wrong you will lose a point.  Note that
you will probably get slightly different questions each time you
attempt the problem set.
<p>
<b>The due date for the Gradiance part of the homework is 11:59pm on Wednesday, November 7, 2012.</b>
