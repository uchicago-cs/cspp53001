<H3>Step 1 of Your Twitter Basic Plus (TBP) App</H3> Your programming
project for CSPP 53001 will be to build a substantial database
application that provides the basic functionality of Twitter and adds
or changes some of the features (hence the "Plus").
You should certainly preserve the basic concepts of tweeting and
following but you are free to add or omit any other aspects such as
HashTags, Favorites, Lists, etc.

<p>
First, you will design the E/R diagram for your TBP, then you
will transform the E/R diagram to a relational schema for the
database, and you will create an actual database using MySQL.
You will populate the database with lots of data, write interactive
queries and modifications on the database.  Finally, you will develop
an online interface to your TBP.  

<p>Your first step is to identify the features of your TBP that you
would like to manage with your database, and to construct an
entity-relationship diagram for the data.  Try to pick an app that is
relatively substantial, but not too enormous.  For example, when
expressed in the entity-relationship model, you might want your design
to have five to ten entity sets, and a similar number of
relationships.  The total number of entity sets plus relationships for
most reasonable designs should be between 10 and 20.  If you feel that
your app is too complex or too simple, please, discuss it with the TAs
or the instructor.

<P>
You should certainly include different kinds of relationships (e.g.,
many-to-one, many-to-many) and different kinds of data (strings, integers,
etc.), but your app is not required to use advanced features,
such as subclassing, multiway relationships, or weak entity sets, if
they are not appropriate for your scenario.

<P>
Here are a few hints on getting started with your E/R diagram.  You can
start with the Users (or perhaps Twitterers?) and Tweets entity sets.
Then you can create two relationship Following and Sends.  Following
will be a many-to-many relationship between Users and Users while
Sends will be a one-to-many relationship between Users and Tweets.
Next, you can consider how to add the concept of Re-tweeting to you
E/R diagram.

<P>
<b>So, here is what you need to do for step 1 of your TBP:</b>
<ol>
<li>Describe the TBP that you propose in a few paragraphs in a text file called <tt>TBP_description.txt</tt>
 Your
description should be brief and relatively informal.  Your description
will be graded only on suitability and conciseness.  <P>

<li>Specify an entity-relationship diagram for your proposed database.
As always, don't forget to underline key attributes and include
arrowheads and rounded arrows indicating the multiplicity of
relationships.  If there are weak entity sets, indicate them by double
lines, as described in class.<p>

<p> The recommended tool for creating your E/R diagram
is <a href="http://erdplus.com/">ERDplus</a>.  Of course, you can draw
the diagram using any software you like. You can also draw the diagram
by hand and then scan it.  Store your ER diagram in a file
called <tt>TBP_ERD.???</tt>.  Note that the file should be in some
readable format such as pdf, bmp or png.

<li>Transform the E/R diagram you created to a relational schema as
follows:

<ul><li>Using the method for translating an E/R diagram to
relations, produce a set of relations for your database design,
underlining key attributes in your relations.


<li>For each relation in your schema, specify a set of nontrivial
functional dependencies that hold based on your particular
app.  <i>Some of your relations may have no nontrivial
functional dependencies.</i>


Show the relational schema and the functional dependencies in a text file
called <tt>TBP_schema.txt</tt>


</ol>


<p> You will submit your homework using the <tt>hwsubmit</tt> command.
Please, create a new directory called hw1_&lt;your_username&gt;,
e.g. hw1_evtimov, and move all of the relevant files there: <tt>TBP_description.txt, TBP_ERD.???, TBP_schema.txt</tt>.  Then, you can submit your work by typing (&lt;path_to&gt; is the directory path to your hw1 directory):
<p> 

<tt>hwsubmit cspp53001 &lt;path_to&gt;/hw1_&lt;your_username&gt;</tt>

<p>

<b>Please make sure that all of the relevant files and no others are in that directory.</b>

<P>
If you are having trouble thinking of any additional features for your
Twitter Basic Plus, or if you are unsure whether your proposed features
are appropriate, please feel free to consult with the instructor or the TAs.

<hr> <h3>Problem Set</h3> You will
complete the problem set using <a
href="http://www.newgradiance.com/">Gradiance</a> (http://www.newgradiance.com/).

<p>
The name of the homework is CSPPDB-Aut12 HW2.  There are 11 questions in this homework - 10 regular questions and one extra credit one (about seven subsets).
All questions in this
problem set are multiple choice.  However, to answer them correctly
you will need to work out their long (general) answers.  A correct
answer is worth 3 points.  You lose a point for each incorrect
answer. You can attempt the problem set as many times as you like; only
your highest score will count.  Note that you will probably get slightly
different questions each time you take it.
<p>
<b>The due date for the Gradiance part of the homework is 11:59pm on Wednesday, October 24, 2012.</b>
